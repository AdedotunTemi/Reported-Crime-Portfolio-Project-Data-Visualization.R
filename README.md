## Overview
This portfolio project analysis is to gain insights into the crime patterns and trends within Derby, this report presents an analysis of the crime data set obtained from Derbyshire, a city in the United Kingdom. The data set comprises information from 642 observations across 18 variables, providing a comprehensive overview of various crime-related aspects in different regions of Derby. The variables include socio-economic factors, population statistics, land area, and the occurrence of different types of crimes such as anti-social behavior, burglary, robbery, vehicle crimes, violent crimes, shoplifting, criminal damage, and more.

## Project Objective
I will be visualizing to determine if and why certain areas were prone to crime. For example, if a particular area has a higher crime rate compared to another area with similar population and land area, further investigation can be done to determine the cause. The primary objective to visualize and provide information that can assist in the decision-making processes for law enforcement agencies, local authorities, and community organizations. By examining the relationships between population, land area, and different types of crimes. I aim to identify areas that may require targeted interventions, resource allocation, or policy adjustments to address and mitigate criminal activities effectively. Additionally, this report will explore the variations in crime rates across different regions within Derby. By analyzing the distribution of crimes across neighborhoods, we can identify areas with higher crime rates, understand the prevalent types of crimes in specific regions, and evaluate the effectiveness of existing crime prevention strategies.

## Dataset
The structure of the dataset indicates that it is a data frame consisting of 642 observations (rows) and 18 variables (columns). Here is the interpretation of each variable:

This data set is very useful for analyzing crime patterns in different parts of Derbyshire. By matching crime indicators with population and land area statistics. 


## Descriptive Statistics

 •The summary statistics show us that difference in Anti Social Behaviour mean 52.35 and medium (36.00) is high, it means that the data is skewed or not evenly distributed. its positively skewed distribution.
 
 •Theft from the person mean (2.22) and medium (1.00) show the data is highly skewed to the right with a skewness value of 20.52, indicating the       presence of some extremely high values

 •The differences in the mean and median values shows that each crime type may be skewed in different directions.
